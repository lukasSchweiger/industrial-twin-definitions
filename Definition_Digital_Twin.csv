Company;Definition
GE;Digital Twin is most commonly defined as a software representation of a physical asset, system or process designed to detect, prevent, predict, and optimize through real time analytics to deliver business value.  At GE Digital, we are focused on how digital twin software can help our customers across three core areas: Asset, Network, and Process.
Oracle;A digital twin is the digital proxy of a physical asset or device. A digital twin can help you successfully deploy and use an IoT application. A digital twin may also be called a twin or a shadow. Digital twin technology may be referred to as device virtualization and can be implemented in differing ways.
Dassault;Digital twins – known as virtual twins when data is communicated via a scientifically accurate 3D model – are among the most powerful digital transformation innovations for bridging the information gap between real world operations and remote workforces. By creating powerful 3D simulations that can be used to understand and accurately predict the results of various strategies before they are implemented, multiple stakeholders (both internal and external) can collaborate to understand and overcome challenges. 
ABB;A digital twin is a complete and operational virtual representation of an asset, subsystem or system, combining digital aspects of how the equipment is built (PLM data, design models, manufacturing data) with real-time aspects of how it is operated and maintained. The capability to refer to data stored in different places from one common digital twin directory enables simulation, diagnostics, prediction and other advanced use cases.
Bosch;The concept of a digital twin, its definition and thus the expectation vary from one manufacturer to another. At least all publications so far agree upon the task to provide a virtual representation of a physical asset. Adding further information and functionality enriches the digital twin into the more generally assumed holistic view that reflects all capabilities and aspects of a device / product asset. In the context of Industrial IoT a digital twin is also called (asset) Administration Shell. IoT Things is a cloud service implementing such a digital twin / administration shell concept for physical assets. These digital twins can contain the virtual representation of a physical asset as well as other information and functionality to provide a holistic view accessible by API.
Anylogic;A digital twin is a special type of simulation model that represents a specific example of something in the present, such as a machine or a business process. It is achieved by combining current data from the subject with its simulation model. The results enhance business insight and performance in manufacturing, transport, supply chain, healthcare, and more, throughout verticals and across industries.
IBM;A digital twin is a virtual model designed to accurately reflect a physical object. The object being studied — for example, a wind turbine — is outfitted with various sensors related to vital areas of functionality. These sensors produce data about different aspects of the physical object’s performance, such as energy output, temperature, weather conditions and more. This data is then relayed to a processing system and applied to the digital copy. Once informed with such data, the virtual model can be used to run simulations, study performance issues and generate possible improvements, all with the goal of generating valuable insights — which can then be applied back to the original physical object.
Deloitte 2017;A digital twin can be defined, fundamentally, as an evolving digital profile of the historical and current behavior of a physical object or process that helps optimize business performance. 
Accenture1;The core concept of Digital Twin is a digital model of a physical object, system or process that exists (or could exist) in the physical world.

Rolls Royce;At their core Digital Twins are virtual replicas of physical devices, products or entities created by combining data with machine learning and software analytics to create digital models that update and change alongside their real-life counterparts. For Rolls-Royce this means creating virtual copies of our pioneering aero engines.
Huawei1;"The idea of a digital twin was first proposed by Professor Michael Grieves from the University of Michigan. He described it as ""a virtual presentation of a physical product"" in the product lifecycle management (PLM) concept. As IT becomes more advanced, the meaning of digital twin is also evolving. According to NASA, a digital twin is about using data, such as physical models, real-time status, and running history, to reproduce, map, and synchronize the shapes, attributes, behaviors, and rules from the physical world in a virtual world through simulation. The simulation is based on established experience and knowledge, so as to reflect the whole lifecycle process of the physical world. With a digital twin, we can digitalize entire processes from product design and production planning to manufacturing execution, making product innovation and manufacturing more efficient. Imagine building a complete digital twin for an entire city. By monitoring a whole urban environment in real time with the digital twin model, we could better utilize city resources and enable intelligent traffic scheduling."
Lenze;The digital twin maps physical components and machines and serves as a collection point for all relevant information. The concept is known as Asset Administration Shell (AAS) and as a basic technology is a real support in industrial automation.
The Industry IoT Consortium;A digital twin is a formal digital representation of some asset, process or system that captures attributes and behaviors of that entity suitable for communication, storage, interpretation or processing within a certain context.

Facebook;A cyber cyber digital twin is a simulation of a software system. By contrast, a cyber physical digital twin is a simulation of a non software (physical) system. Although cyber physical digital twins have received a lot of recent attention, their cyber cyber counterparts have been comparatively overlooked. In this paper we show how the unique properties of cyber cyber digital twins open up exciting opportunities for research and development. Like all digital twins, the cyber cyber digital twin is both informed by and informs the behaviour of the twin it simulates. It is therefore a software system that simulates another software system, making it conceptually truly a twin, blurring the distinction between the simulated and the simulator. Cyber cyber digital twins can be twins of other cyber cyber digital twins, leading to a hierarchy of twins. As we shall see, these apparently philosophical observations have practical ramifications for the design, implementation and deployment of digital twins at Facebook.
Nvidia;A digital twin is a virtual representation — a true-to-reality simulation of physics and materials — of a real-world physical asset or system, which is continuously updated. Digital twins aren’t just for inanimate objects and people. They can be a virtual representation of computer networking architecture used as a sandbox for cyberattack simulations. They can replicate a fulfillment center process to test out human robot interactions before activating certain robot functions in live environments. The applications are as wide as the imagination.
Cisco;Digital twins: Digital representations of advanced manufacturing systems that enable real-time simulation and analysis of sensor data from production processes.
Tata1;Multiple systems collect data, and many global organizations have started leveraging cloud and IoT to gather and collate that data. An autonomous cyber physical system that can work in tandem with a physical entity taking real-time data and providing real-time decisions can optimize KPIs. Development of this system, the digital twin, requires various data mining and analytics activities in addition to modeling, optimization, and control. Toward this end, we have developed a framework for engineering analytics that performs end to end analysis and provides recommendations to help improve operations. Apart from building digital twins of various plants, we hope to extend this platform to design new materials and for predictive maintenance of equipment.
Intel;A digital twin is a virtual model of a process, product or service. This pairing of the virtual and physical worlds allows analysis of data and monitoring of systems to head off problems before they even occur, prevent downtime, develop new opportunities and even plan for the future.
Huawei2;The biggest challenge that city management teams face in data-driven city operations is deriving value from the increasing volume, velocity, and variety of data — also known as big data. To address this challenge, city operations teams are creating data models that can visualize the complex operations of city functions in real-time. These models are known as “digital twins.” Dr. Michael Grieves, one of the concept’s pioneers, defines digital twins as having three parts: physical products in real space, virtual products in virtual space, and connected data that ties the physical and virtual together. These data models are live digital blueprints of physical assets, processes, and entire ecosystems, such as cities. What differentiates digital twins from traditional visualizations is their dynamism and real-time capabilities. Indeed, global market research firm IDC predicts that by 2023, 25% of successful Smart City digital twin platforms will be used to automate processes for increasingly complex, interconnected ecosystems of assets and products.
Hitachi;The digital twin concept is attracting interest in the manufacturing industry. A digital twin is a replica of the real world created in a digital space by bringing together many different types of on-site data. The replica can be used with AI or simulations to help make on-site improvements. Digital Innovation Platform will play an important role in creating digital twins. The platform collects, refines, and stores vast amounts of data generated from production sites. It organizes and integrates the stored data, and then provides it to AI or other applications. This article provides an overview of a Hitachi factory IoT platform that helps create digital twin solutions for production sites. Two of its components are briefly described. One is Hitachi Data Hub, a solution that sequentially links data from the site while collecting, refining, and storing it. The other is a Hitachi digital twin solution that cross-links stored data while organizing and integrating them.
Landis und Gyr;Another application for drones is collecting the data to create digital twins of assets in the field by taking high-resolution photos from multiple angles. Power poles, for instance, endure earthquakes and ground vibration as well as storm-related stresses that could leave them leaning and vulnerable. By creating a digital twin, utilities can evaluate if poles installed by a third party have been installed correctly. “If you have a contractor that didn’t install the pole correctly, you have a picture that gives you some recourse. That’s use number one,” Hewlett says. Use number two is quick identification of leaning poles during routine inspections. Leaning is easy to spot because analytics will show when the tilt of the pole deviates from what is acceptable.
Heidenhain;A digital twin is a realistic model of the machine on a programming station. With it, the machine’s real kinematic behavior, parameters, and functions become available in the office. Its machining simulation can therefore run just like the real machine. This provides greater shop floor assurance that programs created with CAM systems or the programming station will run seamlessly. That saves time on setup, simulation, and shop floor debugging, thereby increasing process reliability and manufacturing productivity
AIA Aerospace Industries Association;A set of virtual information constructs that mimics the structure, context and behavior of an individual / unique physical asset, or a group of physical assets, is dynamically updated with data from its physical twin throughout its life cycle and informs decisions that realize value.

SAS;Digital twin data technology is already deployed to monitor the operational health and functionality of some of the world’s most complex and mission-critical machines. Digital twin versions of jet engines, locomotives and gas turbines are tracking wear and tear on the machinery, maximizing operational efficiency and predicting when these machines will need maintenance – often before they break down.Using exact duplicates to manage complex systems dates back to NASA’s moon missions of the 1960s and 1970s. NASA used mirrored systems, the precursor of digital twins, to rescue the Apollo 13 mission when it ran into trouble. Nearly 50 years later, digital twin technology helps NASA understand and manage the operation of machines that are moving through the vast reaches of our solar system. Digital twin technology uses cloud-connected sensors embedded in machines to upload real-time operational data, producing up-to-date virtual simulations of real-world machines. Manufacturers can then use edge analytics to analyze and evaluate how their products are performing in the field. The ultimate goal: Have a digital twin running for every real-world asset in the field, with the digital twin updating its status as it receives operational data. The Internet of Things (IoT) is key to the implementation of digital twin technology. The increasing affordability of sensors, widespread use of WiFi and the data-throughput capacity of the cloud combine to make the application of large-scale digital twin modeling affordable for a range of manufacturers operating in the industrial IoT. When manufacturers can see real-time data on how their products are operating, they can make dramatic improvements in design, innovation, efficiency and manufacture. That capability enables them to proactively contact end users so plans can be made for repairs or maintenance – heading off the disruption of potentially costly breakdowns.
Boeing;Boeing’s production system is bringing the digital future to life today. By incorporating cloud technology and an interconnected value stream, the company is creating exact digital twins of aircraft by tail number – enabling data-driven maintenance, upgrades and enhancements both for the physical aircraft and its digital copy throughout their lifecycle. Boeing’s factory leverages firm data standards, is networked with other factories via the cloud, and features advanced artificial intelligence to build systems more simply and efficiently. This digitization allows for modular tooling, enabling flexible, scalable production to meet rapid development and fielding or changes in customer needs and requirements. These changes are accompanied by virtual prototyping and testing, higher initial quality and greater safety. And, the system is being implemented today on new and existing programs. Applying the digital engineering and production expertise that developed the Airpower Teaming System and a proprietary government space system to its entire portfolio, Boeing is delivering the speed, flexibility and agility needed for today’s deterrence and the future fight.
Linde;"Being able to predict what's going to happen in 60 days may sound like science fiction, but that's exactly what a modern industrial plant can do. This kind of forecasting calls for a digital twin. These virtual replicas model real-world plants to support a whole range of features and functions. ""We can use a digital twin to fast-forward operating processes and thus take a glimpse into the future,"" explains Thomas Heinzerling, Senior Vice President of Linde Advanced Operations Services. ""These insights are gained by combining a blueprint of the real-world plant with massive streams of operational data and smart algorithms that make sense of all this information."" New data is fed into the digital twin every fifteen minutes. This information is then used to calculate what is going to happen in the plant over the next two months or so. The virtual twin runs faster than its real-life counterpart, allowing operators to plan more effectively and schedule, for example, the optimum window to take a furnace offline for maintenance or cleaning work such as decoking. They can see if a real-world plant is starting to deviate from the optimum operating parameters and can instantly respond with corrective measures geared towards maximizing plant availability."
Nomoko;A Digital Twin is a digital copy of a physical world feature with any associated spatial data integrated, all made accessible and interactive.
U-Blox;1) As virtual representations of the physical system the devices are deployed in, digital twins offer a virtual platform to monitor and optimize the performance of real-world systems .2) The logical consequence of this wave of digital integration are digital twins: cloud-based digital representations of all the  material flows, processes, and machines that make up the industrial process. By tracking “everything,” operations can be optimized at the system level to increase resource efficiency, product quality, and supply chain and distribution transparency. Digital twins of industrial machines would help reduce downtime by predicting failures ahead of time and scheduling maintenance operations rather than being caught by surprise. And they offer operators a platform to test process changes before they are implemented on the factory floor.
Swiss;1) Whereas avatar refers to a virtual figure,  is “a made-up word that combines the two words aviation (flying) and avatar (a virtual figure), and actually refers to an aircraft’s digital twin. It means that all the data and information pertaining to the state of an aircraft’s “health” is digitalised on a user interface. 2) And with the application, which was introduced on the last Digital Day, SWISS is also taking an important step towards virtual reality. The computer program uses digitalised data on the current state of an aircraft’s “health” to create a digital twin, the information from which can be accessed at any time on a digital user interface. This means that operational processes such as aircraft monitoring and the analysis thereof can be completed even faster and with improved precision.
Lonza;One such collaboration involves use of digital twin technology whereby a virtual replica of a physical bioprocessing line is used as a model to test potential changes.
Novartis;We introduce a virtual twin of each patient (Figure 1). In this project a virtual mirror of the patient’s body and the transdermal patch is generated in the computer using a calibrated mechanistic modeling approach. During a transdermal therapy, the digital avatar calculates in silico the coupled physical and biochemical processes that take place during drug release by the transdermal patch and during the drug absorption via the patient’s skin. The twin also simulates the pharmacological response, namely drug  in the patient’s organs, as well as the desired effect(s) the drugs have, for instance pain relief. This digital twin drifts pharmacologically with the patient’s body during therapy and receives feedback. Such feedback can be biomarkers, which we monitor by wearable-sensor technology over the patient’s smartphone.  The twin then looks into the future and proposes the best possible continuation for the therapy. The main benefit of the digital twin is to know where the drug is and where it will go within the body. This avoids overtly bothering the patient with additional tests and prevents over or underdosing in an  intelligent way. The digital twins help us get the appropriate drug dose the patients need – at any given point in time with the current lifestyle of the patient in question – to reach the desired effect defined by the clinician in charge.

But digital twins allow a speed and depth that enables us to take the concept to new places. They allow us to look at interconnected risks, and how these risks evolve in different scenarios. Right here and now.
Yokogawa Insilico;1) In close alignment with customer needs Biotechnology AG has developed a modular suite of Digital Twins that cover key steps during bioprocess development.

Ansaldo Energia Switzerland AG (mit Alleantia);The data collection of the machines allows to pass the information to the SAP Leonardo platform and to provide the information that allows the Polytechnic of Milan to study the model that defines the digital Twin of the physical machine allowing precisely to identify a series of critical parts of the machine and on these a series of clinical variables worthy of a monitoring that can allow some machine and learning algorithms to provide the system with feedback, i.e. information of malfunctions or drift of the product quality of the machine itself that with a period adequate allow to give vital information to the operator and to prevent machine downtime and malfunction problems.
Beckhoff Automation AG;Digital twins from virtual components in deterministic real time: ISG is an open, cross company simulation platform, with which complete production systems including all components (controls, robots, material flow etc.) can be checked and optimized in deterministic real time. The simulations are created from virtual components, which - stored in appropriate libraries - can be reused and exchanged at any time. This means that virtual systems are not created a new each time, but are configured by simply replacing the components. This process can also be completely automated. ISG covers all simulation areas from MiLS over SiLS to Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation. During system testing, deterministic control real-time with guaranteed response times of e.g. 1 ms is achieved by directly connecting real control systems via common field buses and the use of real-time operating systems. In order to put machines and plants virtually into operation before the real assembly and commissioning, a digital image of the real components and the system behavior is created using the original engineering data. With the help of ISG, automation scenarios including fault situation and safety are simulated in advance. The complex interaction of mechanics, electrics and control can thus be tested and optimized at an early stage. The software is ready for use even before the real commissioning. In addition to the virtual commissioning, the digital twin can be used throughout the entire life cycle of the system - without interfering with ongoing production.
Dematic GmbH;iQ Virtual provides an isolated, digital twin of the production environment where extensive testing of the system occurs.

This data not only provides information that can be used to optimize existing physical systems. In fact, for the very first time, the data itself becomes an asset that can be bought and sold – creating a new virtual market for data in the process.
Hexagon Technology Center GmbH;Gartner (2019) defines a Digital Twin as “a software design pattern that represents a physical object with the objective of understanding the asset’s state, responding to changes, improving business operations and adding value.” ” For those operating in the manufacturing and the process industries, quick access to the most up-to-date information in a Digital Twin from the plant floor to the boardroom enables better decisions, improved business processes, enhanced productivity and the reduction of operational risk. To help companies achieve these Digital Twin benefits, Hexagon provides the integrated Project Twin, Operational Twin and Situational Awareness solutions. The overall Digital Twin is the glue that connects these enterprise solutions and their data on one platform, enabling the “single version of the truth” concept. To prevent barriers to adoption, a Digital Twin can be built gradually using Hexagon solutions in different stages. The extent of Digital Twin maturity required is based on the level of digitalization already in place at an organization.

Ramboll AG;Offshore structures such as platforms and wind turbines are billion-dollar investments, and it usually takes a lot of hours and manpower to keep them running optimally, for as long as possible. With True Digital Twins, operation and maintenance costs can be reduced, and decisions on whether to extend the lifetime of an offshore structure can be based on a genuine understanding of the structures. This is what we call intelligent asset management.
Rockwell Automation Switzerland GmbH;Just like real-life twins, every digital twin is different. That’s because a digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical asset — a living replica. A digital twin as a concept doesn’t reflect one universal definition. For instance, we’ve identified at least 11 different types of digital twins typically applied in primarily three distinct phases — design, operation and maintenance. That equals more than 30 possible use cases — and that’s just in the manufacturing space. There are even more use cases if you also consider the installation/commissioning and decommissioning phases. For example, some users rely on a digital twin to optimize the design of a product or manufacturing process, while others use it to optimize product production or production line maintenance. Let’s clarify what digital twins are and how they’re referenced and applied in different scenarios so you can more quickly and uniformly realize the value. Living Replica When we use simulation, we focus on the factors important to us, such as the key performance indicators (KPIs) we want to improve. For example, you might simulate the operation of a car to predict its fuel efficiency measured in miles per gallon (mpg). It’s the same idea with a digital twin, but a digital twin is a living “digital replica.” That means it’s learning and changing. So, with a digital twin, not only could you predict the car’s mpg when it’s driven off the lot, but you also could predict how and when the mpg will degrade. In addition, you could predict when the car would need preventive maintenance to restore its peak performance, not just by mileage driven or time elapsed, but by maintaining a model of the wear based on many factors (mileage, time, temperature, driver behavior, etc.).Leveraging the Difference A digital twin provides great opportunity for use in numerous manufacturing applications. Earlier I mentioned three phases in which digital twins are typically applied: design, operation and maintenance. Add to the complexity of those options the reality that you can have a digital twin of a device (such as drive or motor), process, manufacturing cell or machine, entire production line, plant or a series of plants (enterprise), people and customer behavior, and that gives you countless scenarios. Plus, no two are exactly the same. To tap the potential of a digital twin, first make sure you and its users concur on the goal. With the car and mpg, for example, are you looking at the car’s engine, the exhaust, the gas tank, the entire car, or even the driver? Value comes from talking about the problem and agreeing on how to use the digital twin to solve that problem.
Siemens Energy AG;Digital twins are emerging as invaluable utilities for optimizing products, processes, and performance by enabling predictive maintenance and complex simulations in a risk-free, virtual environment. These capabilities are particularly beneficial in bulk storage and terminal facilities, where profitability is highly contingent on maintaining safety, plant availability, and efficiency of product transfer. A terminal management system digital twin brings information regarding installations, loading, and unloading infrastructure together into a unified digital workspace to achieve these goals. The result is a single-source-of-truth environment where advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for decision-support, and facility performance can be continuously optimized based on an up-to-the-minute digital replica of the plant. A plant twin, is an exact 3D model of the facility, including every valve, tank, pipe, compressor, pump, etc. It is developed using both 2D and 3D computer-aided design (CAD) drawings and details the dimensions and layout of the terminal, providing an interactive platform for users to explore any structural elements down to the component level. A performance twin, is built from the plant’s data streams, such as maintenance history, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) performance figures, duty cycles, real-time data from sensors, and systems, along with other IoT enabled elements of the terminal.
Siemens Healthcare AG;A digital twin is a four-dimensional model (here, time constitutes the 4th dimension) of a care unit, multiple departments or even an entire hospital. A digital twin links the physical and virtual worlds, turning data into actionable insights. This is a key facet of the emerging manufacturing paradigm known as Industry 4.0 A digital twin enables healthcare providers to move assets around, reconfigure departments, and see the effects of changes to the simulated environment. Because it models so many dimensions, the twin produces a detailed look into how the hospital is working. The effectiveness of a healthcare facility digital twin can be enhanced by leveraging powerful data sources like Real-Time Locating Systems. RTLS tracks the movement of equipment, files, even individuals, and can refine the twin’s accuracy in simulating processes. RTLS data can also enable use of the digital twin to predict the availability of equipment and resources, and can rapidly assess the real-world effect of changes suggested by simulations.

Such tools let you simulate every conceivable supply chain scenario: What happens if there are volume fluctuations in vaccine production, if production sites go offline, if airlines can’t handle the excess capacity? The simulation shows how events affect the entire supply chain and which options are available under any given supply chain conditions.
Wärtsilä Services Switzerland AG;In order to maximise the usefulness of data, the analysis needs to be taken beyond a theoretical abstraction of the problem at hand. In other words, data needs to be modelled for the actual vessel or asset in question. To do this, smart operation introduces the concept of a “digital twin”– meaning that each individual vessel and its sailing conditions are modelled by combining advanced machine learning with traditional physical models of the vessel. Gaining a detailed understanding of each unique vessel and its sailing conditions makes it possible to simulate and analyse what has happened in the past, what is happening onboard now, and what can happen in the near future – for example, by modelling the effects of forecasted weather on the voyage. A digital twin is a virtual counterpart of a physical asset that mimics the asset’s desired characteristics. Using a digital twin allows us to simulate how the physical asset behaves and performs without the need to test it in the real world. The digital twin is based on the data collected from its physical counterpart, and thus learns and synchronises with its physical counterpart using advanced machine learning methodologies. Digital twins enable companies to better understand, predict, and optimise the performance of each unique asset. A digital twin can represent an individual asset, an integrated system of assets, or a fleet of assets.
Winterthur Gas & Diesel AG;"Engine Diagnostic System (EDS) software, installed into the DCM computer, uses this data to perform engine diagnostic analyses. The following engine components data are monitored and analysed by the EDS; fuel injection system, exhaust valve gas system, piston running behaviour, scavenge air system, turbo charger, engine control automation system and the gas admission system. The engine performance analysis is based on a detailed thermo physical process model of the engine, custom produced for each vessel engine. The engine simulation thermodynamic model provides the “reference” engine performance for any possible engine operation setting, the ambient conditions, and the type of fuel. The model is tuned separately for each individual engine and calibrated using the recorded data from that engine’s shop tests. It is validated using the sea trials data. As a result, the EDS is the digital twin of the engine in operation."
Johnson Controls;digital Twin is a managed service for the enablement and mapping of smart buildings by creating a digital replica of assets, processes, people, places, systems and devices. While harmonization and the linking of data is its primary use, twins are brought to life by creating a replica environment by leveraging data in and around the building. The buildings' digital twin includes the building structure, location, assets, people, as well as the past, present and future events related to the building and the environment.
